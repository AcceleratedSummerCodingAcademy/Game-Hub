# GameHub
This is the repository for the Final Project of the **2019 Accelerated Summer Coding Academy** (ASCA). For this Final Project we worked as a team to create GameHub, a collection of text-based Python games made by students. The class of 2019 included Max Kampel, Helen Kota, Neel Kulkarni, and Kyler Zhou. The following Python programs were coded by Max Kampel, Helen Kota, and Neel Kulkarni, with help from Ronak Ramachandran, the 2019 ASCA Director. For more information about ASCA, see www.ASCA.ml.

To use GameHub, simply download the entire project and run the main.py file found in the root directory. You will need to have Python 3.7 installed on your computer.
